# Speech and other NLP Datasets
The idea in this chapter is to provide links to publicly available NLP datasets for Chichewa.
## Speech
1. [speech dataset for Chichewa
](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6595625). This dataset was collected as part of the Zindi-Google NLP competition which I participated in. The data consists of varied length audio clips in Chichewa and accompanying transcriptions. See [google-asr-hack-series-africa-asr-data-challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/google-asr-hack-series-africa-asr-data-challenge) for details of the competition. 

## Machine translation
I havent seen any corpus of machine translation dataset yet. However, I'm building the following datasets which are not ready for public release yet but I used them in the benchmrking of Google translation.

## Other NLP
1. [Chichewa news articles dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4315018)
2. [Spoken Chichewa corpus.](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3731994)
