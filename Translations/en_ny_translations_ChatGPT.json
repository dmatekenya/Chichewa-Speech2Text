The type of political campaign that is practiced is expensive and breeds a fertile ground for advance State capture by those who bankroll the campaign.

When the politicians get part of the payment they use part of the money for their personal projects and part of it for campaign materials and other political expenses. That is why the fight against corruption cannot be won if we continue using the same political campaign model. In fact, there are politicians who have established businesses out of money acquired in this way. Their businesses get contracts from the same government they stole capital from.
